## Why Cinch?
Cinch is a CSS library that aims to be a more pure and efficient development experience. We believe that adding a large, heavy CSS library on top of your project's CSS is no way to treat your application. In fact, we're strongly against it.

Cinch was designed as a boilerplate for your projects, but it can just as easily
be used as a library if that suits your project better. Built with a simple, but solid, foundation and a dash of some reusable modules: we believe there is no better way to start your CSS off on the right track.

            <h4>Pure CSS</h4>
            <p>Using Myth, we can take advantage of using bleeding edge CSS features that are still in the oven. This means that the CSS code we have written will soon be <em>official</em> CSS.</p>

        <div class="col-3">
            <h4>Modular</h4>
            <p>We were inspired by many great CSS projects to use a simple and modular approach to styling elements.</p>

            <h4>Clean &amp; Simple</h4>
            <p>We fundamentally disagree that a CSS library should be a heavy, bloated series of mostly unused styles. A CSS library should be small, clean, and efficient.</p>

            <h4>Lorem Ipsum</h4>
