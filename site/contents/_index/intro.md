## Why Cinch?
Cinch is a CSS library that aims to be a more pure and efficient development experience. We believe that adding a large, heavy CSS library on top of your project's CSS is no way to treat your application. In fact, we're strongly against it.

Cinch was designed as a boilerplate for your projects, but it can just as easily
be used as a library if that suits your project better. Built with a simple, but solid, foundation and a dash of some reusable modules: we believe there is no better way to start your CSS off on the right track.
