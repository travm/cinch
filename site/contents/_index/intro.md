## Why Cinch?
Cinch is a CSS library that aims to be a more pure and efficient development experience. We believe that adding a large, heavy CSS library on top of your project's CSS is no way to treat your application. In fact, we're strongly against it.

Instead of primarily acting as a library, Cinch can also be used as a starting point for your stylesheet. Built with a simple, but solid, foundation and a dash of some reusable modules: we believe there is no better way to start your CSS off on the right track.

            <p>By using Myth, we can take advantage of using bleeding edge CSS features that are still in the oven. This means that the CSS code we have written will soon be <em>official</em> CSS.</p>

            <h4>Modular</h4>
            <p>We were inspired by many great CSS projects to use a simple and modular approach to styling elements.</p>

            <h4>Clean &amp; Simple</h4>
            <p>We fundamentally disagree that a CSS library should be a heavy, bloated series of mostly unused styles. A CSS library should be small, clean, and efficient.</p>
