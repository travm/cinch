# Insight
<p class="lead">
Some insight on what Cinch is, and what it isn't. This section will go over some common questions and concerns that both the developers and users have so you can better determine if Cinch is right for you.

### Why no color classes?
In favor of color classes, I've opted for just providing color variables that provide some great defaults from [clrs.cc](http://clrs.cc). Cinch aims to be flexible as possible without being too opinionated. Some users may want classes for 10 colors, others may want 3. We feel variables are the perfect way to provide those without polluting the class list.


### Wait, is this a library like Bootstrap?
No. Not at all. Cinch is better described as a lightweight _starting point_ that you can build your project with. Instead of including a library and then writing CSS on top of it in a separate file, Cinch aims to be your project CSS file(s). Start with Cinch and then add in and/or modify code as you need it.
